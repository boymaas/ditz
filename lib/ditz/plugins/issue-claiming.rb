## issue-claiming ditz plugin
## 
## This plugin allows people to claim issues. This is useful for avoiding
## duplication of work---you can check to see if someone's claimed an
## issue before starting to work on it, and you can let people know what
## you're working on.
##
## Commands added:
##   ditz claim: claim an issue for yourself or a dev specified in project.yaml
##   ditz unclaim: unclaim a claimed issue
##   ditz mine: show all issues claimed by you
##   ditz claimed: show all claimed issues, by developer
##   ditz unclaimed: show all unclaimed issues
##
## Usage:
##   1. add a line "- issue-claiming" to the .ditz-plugins file in the project
##      root
##   2. (optional:) add a 'devs' key to project.yaml, e.g:
## devs: 
##   :roy: Roy Baty <roy@marsproject.com>
##   :pris: Pris Stratton <pris@marsproject.com>

##   3. use the above commands to abandon
